NOTICE:

When testing in a sandboxed enviroment, you will encounter MANY permission errors (kryptos will just skip these), however this means that not all files will be encrypted. 

Kryptos utalizes several commands to try elevate privelleges, however if this doesnt work, it will work with the current permissions it has.
Running as admin will cause a significant increase in encyrptions which can be leveraged to test this application further and see the outcome and time it takes.
